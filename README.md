This is a brief about yours truely!
I write and rewrite these words like they are my biography (and they technically are 🤷🏽‍♂️) on the 10th day of 2025's February.    
My full name as given to me by my Papa is <u>**Isioma Emmanuel Osawele**</u>. I am told I came to life mid third quarter, about 25 autumnal equinox seasons ago.  Ok, lets skip some 22 years. They're boring formation years. 🥱
Yeah! recently, I've bagged a BSc in Industrial Physics as a scientific researcher. You can look up an example of my research work [here](https://journals.nipes.org/index.php/jmsc/article/view/657/650). ✌🏾
Even more recently, I've been pentesting as an Ethical Hacker almost entirely by myself. (God! I need people! 😂) I've complete a number of Cisco courses, like in [Ethical Hacking](https://www.credly.com/badges/bb918a50-f696-43dd-9f2c-9d383c302b97/linked_in_profile), [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.credly.com/badges/67e6cf22-9d5f-47f7-ac01-a48cff9e61e1/public_url), [Networking](https://www.credly.com/badges/02d2151d-6cee-43ae-aed1-3f65335d28f6/linked_in_profile) and so on... Yep! You can check em' out with the provided links.  I also joined an online school (Regonet Global - Ethical Hacker) and got their [certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1457f5y4lDLwCyq_OcVNygN70NoF11jpI/view?usp=sharing) too! Now I test networks and APIs and stuff, and I report back to whomever I need to report back to - cos I'm Ethical! (at least, I try to be...)

Anyway, I've grounded myself on [Python](https://github.com/Osawele/pythons.git) and [BaSH scripting](https://github.com/Osawele/bash_scripts.git) along the way. You can check out my works on those by following the provided links. They're all here on github. I could also be getting in on rails later 🤔(or not...🤷🏽‍♂️)
More to these messy stuffs, I'ma get in on some pentesting of some intentionally vulnerable websites and drop the links to their reports here so you can check em out too. For now, ✌🏾

Yeah, on more thing: if you'd like to see how weird I can be on socials or contact me for some good old professional, work related stuffs, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isioma-emmanuel-osawele
) and [X (formally twitter)](https://x.com/creator_e99)

Alright, for now... really ✌🏾
